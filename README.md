# AI Investment Property Project

## Overview
The AI Investment Property Project uses AI agents to identify and summarize promising investment properties in Australia. The project consists of two agents:
- **Research Agent**: Conducts research to find potential investment properties.
- **Writer Agent**: Summarizes the research findings into a report for investors.

When you run the project, it automatically generates a `report.txt` file that contains data about the best investment properties in Australia.
